DDQN for solving the lunar lander problem on OpenAi Gym
To run the codes, OpenAI Gym, tensorflow and keras need to be installed. tensorflow is run as a backend for keras. Start tensorflow first, then in the command line,type:

python lunar_lander.py

This will generate the reward of each episode for both training and test period. Change the parameters correspondingly in the lunar_lander.py file to generate results for different parameter settings.

To generate all the plots, in the command line, type:

python plots.py
